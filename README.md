Landing page project as part of The Odin Project curriculum

This is a Landing page project. As part of this, I'll apply the Flexbox knowledge I gathered so far. 

By the end of this, I should be able to create a fully designed LP, with a navbar, images, structure, paragraphs and boxes that shrink and grow.

Let's go!
